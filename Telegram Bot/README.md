## Telegram Bot
To further facilitate the users, we've implemented a **Telegram Bot** to automatically answer the queries of the users without any human assistance.

To talk to the bot, you can either go to the chat from our app or simply mention it in Telegram using *@idtool_bot*

##### Functions

If you are starting a chat with the bot for the first time on Telegram, just write ```/start``` to start the bot.

#### Say Hi
User  can say "Hi", "Hello", "Hallo" and the bot will respond accordingly

#### Ask for Contact Details
User can ask for contact details of some office e.g. BÃ¼rgeramt, Finanzamt by typing any sentence containing the keyword **contact** or **kontakt**. You can then select the office of which you want the contact details. The bot will then send you the details of that office.

#### Ask for Address
Similar to Contact Details. User can ask for address of some office by typing some sentence containing the keyword **address** or **location**. The bot will then send the address of the selected office.
