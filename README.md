### Hackathon project for SmartCountry{hacks} in Berlin
#### by team "A Small Loan of a Million $'s"


Since the hackathon is over, the firebase backend was shut down, so in order to try this project on your own, you have to replace the firebase API-Keys in the project with your own :)

## Backend

All backend code is provided by firebase and its configuration is contained in the /firebase folder.
But as of now its basically just used to deploy the website to firebase to test on mobile.


## Frontend

The frontend is implemented in Angular 5 and TypeScript. Its code is contained in the /frontend folder. The README.md file in this folder contains the running instructions.

## Telegram Bot

The source code and how-to for Telegram Bot can be found under ```Telegram Bot/```

## running the Project:
from the git-base directory change into frontend/ and execute
```
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
to install the necessary dependencies. (This assumes NodeJS and NPM are already installed.)
To start the project's webserver, run:
```
ng serve
```
